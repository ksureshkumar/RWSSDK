# RWSSDK

Introduction
-------------
RWS SDK is a wrapper that handles all the low level plumbing required for HTTP session management, attaching appropriate headers, cookies, request and response formats, web sockets and so on. The SDK exposes the resource representations as a set of programming constructs that makes it easier for an application to consume the RWS API responses by eliminating the need for parsing the raw XHTML/JSON responses


Based on .Net Framework 4.6.1 and Visual Studio 2017
